*Written report: 
•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
1.	Plays/Theater has the most successful rate.
2.	Overall, the successful number of crowdfunding campaigns is high. The successful rate is roughly 57%
3.	The summer period (from May to August) is when the campaigns are most active.
•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset represents only the outcome but not the factors that affect it. The only limitation that I can see from this dataset is it is hard to come to a good conclusion on how to be succeed on received funding.
•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
*Statistical Analysis:
The mean and median are both useful when it comes to summarize the data. Mean give us the avarage number and median show us the central number of the dataset. By utilizing both tools, we can spot whether we have mutated or an odd number that going off the normal flow of the dataset.
